# Task 4: Classification with Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates binary classification using the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-learn.

## Steps:
1. Load and preprocess data
2. Train-test split and standardize features
3. Train logistic regression model
4. Evaluate using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
5. Visualize ROC curve and threshold analysis

## How to Run:
```bash
python logistic_regression_model.py
